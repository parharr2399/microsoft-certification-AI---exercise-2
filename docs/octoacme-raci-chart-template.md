# OctoAcme RACI Chart Template

## Purpose
Use this RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) chart to clarify roles and responsibilities for project activities and deliverables. This ensures clear ownership, reduces confusion, and prevents gaps in accountability.

## RACI Definitions

- **R (Responsible)**: Person(s) who do the work to complete the task. Multiple people can be Responsible.
- **A (Accountable)**: Person ultimately answerable for the correct completion. Only one person should be Accountable per task.
- **C (Consulted)**: People whose opinions are sought; two-way communication.
- **I (Informed)**: People who are kept up-to-date on progress; one-way communication.

## How to Use This Template

1. **Copy this template** for each major project or initiative
2. **Customize phases** to match your project lifecycle (Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, etc.)
3. **List key activities and deliverables** in the left column
4. **Assign RACI roles** for each activity:
   - Ensure every row has exactly ONE Accountable (A) person
   - Assign Responsible (R) to those doing the work (can be the same as A)
   - Mark Consulted (C) for those providing input
   - Mark Informed (I) for those receiving updates
5. **Review with the team** during project kickoff or planning
6. **Update as needed** if roles or responsibilities change

## Tips for Effective RACI Charts

- **Keep it simple**: Don't create RACI charts for every minor task
- **Focus on key deliverables**: Target important milestones and deliverables
- **One Accountable only**: Having multiple A's creates confusion
- **Review regularly**: Update as project scope or team structure changes
- **Discuss conflicts**: If multiple people want to be Accountable, facilitate a discussion
- **Avoid too many C's**: Too many people in Consulted can slow down decisions
