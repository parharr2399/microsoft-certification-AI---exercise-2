# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management process documentation. This guide serves as the main entry point for understanding how we manage projects and deliver value to our customers.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on six core principles designed to ensure successful project delivery while fostering a collaborative and learning-oriented environment:

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize user value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver in small, testable increments to maintain agility and reduce risk
- **Clear ownership**: Named Project Manager and Product Lead for each initiative ensure accountability
- **Data-informed**: Measure and iterate based on evidence rather than assumptions
- **Psychological safety**: Value feedback and team learning to continuously improve
- **Full lifecycle**: Follow a structured approach from Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective
